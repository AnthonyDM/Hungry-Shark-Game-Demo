# Hungry-Shark-Game-Demo
Hungry Shark Game prototype for LuvBug Learning

This demo was created for an interview test for Luvbug Learning. Created in Unity with a few Assets downloaded from the Asset Store. As well as a few sound effects and ambience from Freesounds.org!

My thoughts:
I spent a good 20 minutes thinking over gameplay that an 8-year-old would easily play and enjoy and thought of the fun flash games I used to play as a kid, they were very simple and I wanted to capture that simple but fun feeling. 
I didn't run into any issues while working on the prototype, though if I had a bit more time, I would have expanded the gameplay a little more with score multipliers and gradually make the game faster as you kept playing.
For the gameplay, I went with a one button approach to keep it simple but still fun. There's a bit of depth with the positioning of the shark as you make him swim up to the current of fish, with the tiny delay I put in to make it swim upwards. I feel like with this approach children from 7 and older would appreciate the simplicity!

Overall, I had a blast with the project, There was a little hiccup where I had to burn a half an hour due to a home mishap but besides that I felt confident while working on it.
